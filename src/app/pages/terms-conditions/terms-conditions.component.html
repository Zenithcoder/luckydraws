                    If you play you can win or lose. Gambling can be fun, exciting but there is no economic or
                    mathematical certainty because of course, it’s only a game. In the worst cases you buy a little
                    excitement at the right price.

                  <p class="text">
                    What is the right price? For sure it’s what you can afford to gamble while feeling completely at
                    ease. You decide in advance how much to spend on betting and never exceed that limit. You keep the
                    commitment you have made to yourself.
                  </p>
                  <p class="text">
                    Problem gambling can be recognised by modes of conduct such as a high level of spending, poor work
                    results, relationship difficulties, theft, lying and depression. If gambling becomes a problem then
                    it is no longer entertainment. If gambling worries you take a break.
